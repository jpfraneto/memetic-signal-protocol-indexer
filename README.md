# Memetic Signal Protocol - Blockchain Indexer

## What is MSP?

The **Memetic Signal Protocol (MSP)** is a decentralized reputation system that lets you build credibility by making precise cryptocurrency price predictions. Think of it as a way to prove your market intuition and earn social capital by correctly timing crypto market movements.

Unlike traditional prediction markets where timing doesn't matter much, MSP rewards **precision timing** above all else. A prediction that comes true in 1 day gives you full reputation points, while the same prediction over 300 days gives you almost nothing. This creates genuine skill-based competition rather than safe long-term speculation.

## How This Indexer Fits Into The Complete System

This indexer is the **nervous system** of the MSP ecosystem. While users make predictions and see results, this indexer is constantly watching the blockchain and immediately organizing all the prediction data so the system can respond instantly to what's happening.

### üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture Overview**

The complete MSP system has 5 main parts:

1. **üì± Mobile App (Farcaster Miniapp)** - Where users make predictions
2. **‚õìÔ∏è Smart Contract (Base Blockchain)** - Stores predictions permanently and securely  
3. **üëÅÔ∏è Blockchain Indexer (This Repository)** - Watches blockchain and organizes all the data
4. **üß† Backend Server** - Calculates scores and manages the system
5. **üíæ Database & Cache** - Stores user data and keeps things running fast

### ‚ö° **How A Prediction Works (Step by Step)**

1. **User Makes Prediction**: Someone opens the app and predicts "Token XYZ will go UP in 3 days"
2. **Smart Contract Records It**: The prediction is permanently stored on Base blockchain
3. **Indexer Sees It Instantly**: This indexer immediately detects the new prediction
4. **Data Gets Organized**: The indexer processes all the details and stores them in an organized database
5. **Backend Gets Notified**: The main server learns about the prediction and sets up automatic resolution
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Everyone can see new predictions instantly because the indexer keeps everything up-to-date

## üëÅÔ∏è **What Makes This Indexer Special**

### **Real-Time Blockchain Monitoring**
- Watches the Base blockchain **24/7** for any MSP activity
- Detects new predictions within **seconds** of being made
- Never misses a transaction - even during network congestion
- Processes events in the exact order they happened on blockchain

### **Intelligent Data Organization**
- Takes raw blockchain data and makes it easy to understand
- Tracks user statistics (total predictions, win rate, reputation score)
- Monitors system health (daily prediction counts, banned users, etc.)
- Stores token information (names, prices, market caps) for quick access

### **Lightning-Fast Queries**
- Pre-processes data so the app responds instantly
- Maintains user leaderboards and statistics in real-time
- Enables complex searches (find all predictions by user, token, time period)
- Supports the main app's need for immediate data access

### **Token Intelligence**
- Automatically fetches token information from CoinGecko and DexScreener
- Stores historical market data for accurate resolution calculations
- Handles new tokens that aren't in major databases yet
- Rate-limits API calls to respect data provider restrictions

## üîç **What The Indexer Tracks**
